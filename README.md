Code style
--------------------------

This project uses [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint), provided via
the [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) gradle plugin, and the bundled project IntelliJ codestyle.

If you find that one of your pull reviews does not pass the CI server check due to a code style conflict, you can
easily fix it by running: `./gradlew spotlessApply`, or running IntelliJ/Android Studio's code formatter.
